  DPDK is a set of libraries and drivers for fast packet processing. It
  was designed to run on any processors knowing Intel x86 has been the
  first CPU to be supported. Ports for other CPUs like IBM Power 8 and
  ARM are under progress. It runs mostly in Linux userland. A FreeBSD
  port is now available for a subset of DPDK features.
  
  Notes:
  * To build the included Linux Kernel drivers, it is necessary to
  enable CONFIG_PCI_MSI, CONFIG_UIO.
  * To build the PCAP PMD properly, you need to enable the libpcap
  manually.
  * To install the python scripts (dpdk_nic_bind.py, cpu_layout.py),
  enable the python2 interpreter for the target.
